    "You are given an integer array gifts denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:\n",
    "* Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.\n",
    "* If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.\n",
    "* Reduce the number of gifts in the pile to the floor of the square root of the original number of gifts in the pile.\n",
    "* Return the number of gifts remaining after k seconds.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "- Input: gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4\n",
    "- Output: 29\n",
    "- Explanation: The gifts are taken in the following way:\n",
    "    - In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "    - Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "    - After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "    - Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "- The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.\n",

    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "- Input: gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4\n",
    "- Output: 4\n",
    "- Explanation: \n",
    "    - In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile. \n",
    "    - That is, you can't take any pile with you. \n",
    "- So, the total gifts remaining are 4.\n",
